//	1. Hashing: When you put a key-value pair into a HashMap, it uses the keyâ€™s hashCode method to compute a hash value.
//	This hash value is used to determine the bucket in which the entry will be stored.
//	2. Buckets: The HashMap maintains an array of buckets. Each bucket is essentially a linked list of entries that have the same hash value.
//	If multiple keys hash to the same bucket, they are stored in that bucket in a linked list structure.
//	3. Equals Method: When retrieving a value from a HashMap, the hashCode is used to find the right bucket,
//	and then the equals method is used to find the exact key within that bucket.
