    //reason for introducing JAVA 8 was to introduce Conciseness in the code.
    //JAVA brings in Functional programming which is enabled by Lambda expressions
    // (a powerful tool to create concise code base.)
    //If you have ever observed, with Python, Scala we can do the same thing in Very less LOC.
    //By mid 20s JAVA lost a large market due to these languages. To prevent further loss java upgraded itself
    //from Only OOPs language to some concepts of FP to create concise code base.

    //Q) What are new features which got introduced in Java 8?
    //New Features

    1. Lambda Expressions
    2. Stream API
    3. Functional Interface

    7. Method Referencing and Constructor Referencing
    8. Date API

    O) What are main advantages of using Java 8? Main advantages

    More readable and reusable code
    More testable code
    Parallel operations
